Hello, 
This is just a quick note to give instructions on running my solutions. 
1. TinyShell is implemented in a file called tinyShell.c.
2. Each of my fork, vfork, and clone implementations has it's own file. They are called mySystemf2, mySystemvf, and mySystemc (respectively). If you just write a.out then thats all you need to run them. 
3. My fifo expects you to pass it an arg which specifies reading or writing and then the pipe. An example command to run it would be: 
		a.out R PIPE_310 or a.out W PIPE_310

Hopefully this is all you will need :) 

Many thanks!
